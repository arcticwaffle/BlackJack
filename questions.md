#Questions
1. Not a whole lot is broken in my code. The only things that I do not like are the button and card spacing in the window and the neatness of the code.
2. THere are a couple things that set my code apart from other sutdents. It works well. My code uses the size of the window to center the position of the cards and labels.
3. Classes are used in complicated programs for many reasons. Classes help keep code neat and tidy which also makes it easier to debug. Classes also make it easy to create numerous objects that work with much higher efficeincy than a list of procedures.
4. Private variables are variables that are only accessible in the class that they are defined in. Public variables are the opposite. They can be accessed and altered from anywhere. Public and Private methods are the same thing except that they are methods not variables.
5. A Class is a division of code that defines an object and what it does. An instance is the creation of that object or objects.
6. Inheritance, in programming, is when two or more classes are connected. A parent class would be the father of a child class. The child class has all of the behavior and state of the parent class. This is useful when two very similar objects are needed with slight differences then a parent class can be created that gives them both the same general functions and the child class can hold the other functions that make them different from each other.
7. The keyword this is used to refer sepcifically to the class that the keyword is in. The keyword super is used to refer to the parent class if it has one.
8. All objects have a state which is the characteristics or variables of an object, and all objects hae a behavior which is defined in the methods of an object.
9. Nothing really. I feel like I have it down in my mind, but I think you will probably find some issues in my execution of object oriented design.
